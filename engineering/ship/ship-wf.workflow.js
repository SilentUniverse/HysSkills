   Read the body's "做什么"/"实现决策" to infer which modules/paths it touches (consult CONTEXT.md code paths if present).
3. Keep only status: ready-for-agent issues. An issue is runnable only when every blocker is already done OR scheduled in an earlier wave. If a blocker is ready-for-human, DEFER the dependent (can't auto-run past a human gate) — list it under deferred with that reason.
4. Build ordered waves: issues in the SAME wave must touch DISJOINT modules (parallel-safe). When unsure whether two issues share a module, put them in different waves — a wrong parallelization corrupts work, a wrong serialization only costs time.
5. doneCount = number of status: done issues in ${ISSUES} (exclude archive/).

You are running in an ISOLATED git worktree on your own branch — your commits do not touch other agents. Do NOT switch branches, do NOT merge to main, do NOT push.

This issue is status: ready-for-agent — the issue body is the spec. Do NOT ask for confirmation; the AC are the priority.

Follow the /tdd skill discipline:
- Existing-test scan first: for each AC, skip if already covered (note it), else write a test.
- Vertical tracer bullets: one test -> minimal code -> repeat. Never write all tests then all code.
- Each red-green cycle runs ONLY the test you just wrote + the touched module's tests (seconds-long loop), NOT the whole suite.
- Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details.

VERIFICATION GATE (hard): commands are cached in docs/agents/domain.md (infer from project config if absent, then write them back). Run build + the touched modules' tests — scoped, NOT the whole suite (the orchestrator runs the full suite once after merge-back). You may commit ONLY if they pass.
- On pass: in THIS worktree, commit the code + tests + the issue file with frontmatter status: done and a "### 完成 — <date> (commit <hash>)" record appended to ## Comments (test files + case counts). Then report your branch (\`git branch --show-current\`) and short hash (\`git rev-parse --short HEAD\`). Return result "done".
- On fail: do NOT commit. Return result "failed" with a short reason. Leave branch/commit empty.

**Do NOT modify .scratch/INDEX.md** — the orchestrator regenerates it once after merge-back, so per-worktree edits would collide.

Touched modules (do not stray outside without reason): ${issue.modules.join(', ') || 'infer from the issue'}.

Return verdict "pass" only if BOTH axes hold:
- **Spec compliance** — every AC is met, with NO over-build (features/abstractions/config beyond the AC — scope creep is a fail) and NO under-build (a missing AC).
- **Code quality** — matches existing style, no leftover debug/commented-out code, no obvious defects, and the new tests verify behavior through public interfaces (not implementation details, not tautological assertions).
