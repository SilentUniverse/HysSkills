description: Sets up an `## Agent skills` block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and `docs/agents/` so the engineering skills know this repo's issue tracker (local markdown by default), state vocabulary, and domain doc layout. Run before first use of `to-issues`, `to-prd`, `tdd`, `diagnose`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, or `zoom-out` — or if those skills appear to be missing context about the issue tracker, states, or domain docs.

# Setup (hys-setup)

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (local markdown by default; see below)
- **State vocabulary** — the strings used for the three issue states
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist? If yes, what does `issue-tracker.md` describe (local markdown, GitHub `gh` CLI, GitLab `glab`, other)?
- `.scratch/` — sign that the local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use. If present, sample one issue file: does it have a `Status:` line and `## Comments` section?
- Other PRD-like locations: `docs/prd/`, `docs/specs/`, `requirements/`, `prds/`, `specs/`
- Other issue-like locations: `issues/`, `tasks/`, `tickets/`

### 2. Migration check

Classify the repo into one of four cases based on what step 1 found, and announce the case to the user before proceeding:

**Case 1 — Clean repo.** No `.scratch/`, no `docs/agents/`, no existing `## Agent skills` block. Skip migration; proceed to step 3.

**Case 2 — Already on hys conventions.** `.scratch/<feat>/issues/*.md` files have `Status:` lines that already match the 3-state vocabulary in `triage-labels.md` (`ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / `done`). Tell the user setup will refresh `docs/agents/*.md` only, leaving issue files untouched. Proceed to step 3.

**Case 3 — Old setup detected (`mattpocock/skills` 5-state, or earlier hys 6-state).** Either `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` references `gh` / `glab` CLI, or existing issue files use deprecated states (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `wontfix`, `inbox`, `blocked`, `doing`, `shelved`). Offer:

- (a) **Switch to local-markdown + 3-state vocabulary.** Rewrite `docs/agents/*.md`. For each existing issue with a deprecated state, **ask the user one-by-one** what to do: promote to `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human` / mark `done` (if commit already exists) / delete. Do not silently rewrite the `Status:` line.
- (b) **Keep the old GitHub/GitLab tracker.** User explicitly chose `Other` in Section A.

**Case 4 — PRD/issue-like files at non-default paths.** Surface the paths found. Offer two options, recommending (i) by default since it is non-destructive:

- (i) **Configure paths in place.** Write the actual paths into `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` so the skills read/write there. No file moves.
- (ii) **Adopt new layout.** Help the user move/symlink existing files into `.scratch/<feat>/` structure. Show the planned moves before executing; use `git mv` where possible.

In all cases, present what was found and the proposed migration plan for the user to confirm before any file is changed. Do not silently rewrite existing user content.

### 3. Present findings and ask

Walk the user through the three decisions **one at a time** — present a section, get the user's answer, then move to the next. Don't dump all three at once.

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). Then show the choices and the default.

**Section A — Issue tracker（issue 追踪位置）.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues and PRDs live for this repo. `to-issues`, `triage`, and `to-prd` read from and write to it.

Default and recommended: **local markdown**. These skills run fully offline by default, with no network or account dependencies. Pick this unless the user specifically requests otherwise:

- **Local markdown（default）** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<feature>/`; pure local, zero external dependencies.
- **Other** (GitHub / GitLab / Jira / Linear, etc.) — only when the user explicitly asks. Have the user describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill records it verbatim into `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. Note: this introduces external CLI/account dependencies, conflicting with the local-first goal; the user is responsible for the corresponding environment setup.

**Section B — State vocabulary（状态词汇）.**

> Explainer: Each issue file under `.scratch/<feat>/issues/` carries a `Status:` line at the top. We use a **3-state minimal model** tuned for solo dev + agent assistance — no triage, no inbox, no blocked.

The three canonical states:

- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, fire-and-forget OK (dispatch to a subagent)
- `ready-for-human` — fully specified, but needs hands-on judgment / design taste / manual / device testing
- `done` — completed; **immutable** (git has the commit; revisions are new issues)

Default: each role's string equals its name. Ask the user if they want to override any.

**Section C — Domain docs（领域文档布局）.**

> Explainer: Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnose`, `tdd`) read `CONTEXT.md` for the project's domain language and `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions. They need to know whether the repo is single-context or multi-context (e.g. a monorepo with separate frontend/backend contexts) so they look in the right place.

Confirm the layout:

- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. Most repos are this.
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (typically a monorepo).

### 4. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 5. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create — don't pick for them.

Never create `AGENTS.md` when `CLAUDE.md` already exists (or vice versa) — always edit the one that's already there.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### State vocabulary

[one-line summary of the three states]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout — "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Then write the three docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md) — local-markdown issue tracker（默认）
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md) — label mapping
- [domain.md](./domain.md) — domain doc consumer rules + layout

For a non-default issue tracker (the user explicitly chose "Other"), write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 6. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
